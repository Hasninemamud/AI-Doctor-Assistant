CORRELATION ANALYSIS:

During headache episodes: 135-158/85-98 mmHg
Hypertensive readings during severe episodes: >140/90 mmHg

CONCERNING PATTERNS:
===================
• Progressive increase in baseline BP over 3 weeks
• Significant spikes during headache episodes
• Some readings approaching Stage 2 Hypertension (≥140/90)
• BP elevation preceding some headache episodes

MEDICATION IMPACT:
=================
• Sumatriptan (started Aug 10): Temporary BP increase post-dose
• Ibuprofen: Minimal effect on BP
• Pain-related stress causing BP elevation

LIFESTYLE FACTORS:
=================
• Sleep quality: Poor during headache weeks
• Stress level: High (work deadlines)
• Caffeine intake: Variable (affects both BP and headaches)
• Physical activity: Reduced due to headaches

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOCTOR:
==========================
1. Evaluate relationship between BP and headaches
2. Consider cardiovascular workup
3. Review hypertension risk factors
4. Assess medication effects on BP
5. Lifestyle modification counseling

3. **demo_bp_log.txt** as "Blood Pressure Log"

### 6. Request AI Analysis
- Submit for comprehensive AI analysis
- The system should detect:
  - **Primary concern**: Migraine headaches with aura
  - **Risk level**: Moderate to High
  - **Emergency flags**: Speech difficulties, persistent visual changes

- Seek neurological evaluation within 48 hours
- Document any new or worsening symptoms

**Medical Follow-up (High Priority)**:
- Primary care appointment within 1 week
- Neurology referral recommended
- Consider brain imaging (MRI)
- Blood pressure evaluation

**Lifestyle Modifications (High Priority)**:
- Limit screen time to 2-hour intervals
- Establish regular sleep schedule
- Identify and avoid known triggers
- Stay hydrated, eat regular meals

**Self-Care Measures (Medium Priority)**:

### 8. Test Key Features

**Pattern Detection**: 
- App should identify the 3-week progression
- Detect correlation between triggers and episodes
- Note escalating severity pattern

**Risk Assessment**:
- Should flag speech difficulties as concerning
- Identify blood pressure elevation pattern
- Note medication overuse developing

**Emergency Detection**:

- Flag persistent visual changes
- Recommend immediate medical evaluation

**Timeline Analysis**:
- Track symptom progression over time
- Identify trigger patterns
- Show severity trending upward
